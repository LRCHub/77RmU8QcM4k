You're too good for me, I don't feel worthy.
I've told you this before, you've always known the score.
Cause only you can give me the reassurance that I need.

I've told myself though it don't seem to help,
Told myself though it don't seem to help cause only you can show me.

Can you see me? For the shadow that I am.
Do you believe me? When I'm as shallow as I am.
I'm waiting patiently for the Polaroid to take hold.
Then all my secrets, they will unfold.

I only wanted someone to lift me from despair.
When I turn a corner I'd like you to be waiting there.
Cause only you can teach me the resources that I need.

I hold myself though it don't seem to help.
Hold myself though it don't seem to help cause only you can show me.

Can you see me? For the shadow that I am.
Do you believe me? When I'm as shallow as I am.
I'm waiting patiently for the Polaroid to take hold.
Then all my secrets, they will unfold.
