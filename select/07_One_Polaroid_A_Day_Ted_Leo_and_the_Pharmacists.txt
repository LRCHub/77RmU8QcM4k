One Polaroid a day
Perfect every single way
Anchor in a winding ley
Let's get on while others hang on to document decay

But you want to control everything
You are your own worst enemy
And you don't want to talk about it

But in the time it takes to your cameras on
You can keep on clicking but the moment's gone
I said in the time it takes to your cameras on
You can keep on clicking but the moment's gone

You want to control everything
You are your own worst enemy

One Polaroid a day
The discipline to let things play
And ever-present to remain
Untethered in the Old King's Road, you can pull the trigger and then let it go

But you want to control everything
You are your own worst enemy
And you don't want to talk about it

But in the time it takes to your cameras on
You can keep on clicking but the moment's gone
I said in the time it takes to your cameras on
You can keep on clicking but the moment's gone

You want to control everything
You are your own worst enemy
You kill the moment when you cling
Lay down your ownership and sing
