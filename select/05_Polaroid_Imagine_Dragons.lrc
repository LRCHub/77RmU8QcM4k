[00:01.84] I'm a reckless mistake
[00:04.69] I'm a cold night's intake
[00:07.53] I'm a one night too long
[00:11.28] I'm a "come on too strong"
[00:24.28] 
[00:13.11] All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
[00:16.16] Can't slow down, I'm a rollin' freight train
[00:19.25] One more time, gotta start all over
[00:22.26] Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover
[00:40.76] 
[00:38.93] I'm a hold my cards close
[00:41.85] I'm a wreck what I love most
[00:44.13] I'm a first class let down
[00:48.32] I'm a "shut up, sit down"
[01:00.82] 
[00:50.44] I am a head case, I am the color of boom
[00:54.60] That's never arriving and you are the pay raise
[00:58.10] Always a touch out of view
[01:00.91] And I am the color of boom
[01:13.91] 
[01:03.42] All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
[01:06.03] Can't slow down, I'm a rollin' freight train
[01:09.09] One more time, gotta start all over
[01:11.99] Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover
[01:15.17] Woah, how did it come to this?
[01:18.35] Oh, love is a polaroid
[01:21.40] Oh, better in picture
[01:25.83] But never can fill the void
[01:39.33] 
[01:40.84] I'm a midnight talker
[01:44.26] Oh, I'm an alley walker
[01:47.49] I'm a day late two face
[01:50.58] Oh, I'm a burn out quick pace
[02:05.08] 
[01:53.10] I am a head case, I am the color of boom
[01:57.09] That's never arriving and you are the opera
[02:00.06] Always on time and in tune
[02:03.14] And I am the color of boom
[02:16.14] 
[02:05.29] All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
[02:08.29] Can't slow down, I'm a rollin' freight train
[02:11.23] One more time, gotta start all over
[02:14.11] Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover
[02:17.56] Woah, how did it come to this?
[02:20.89] Oh, love is a polaroid
[02:25.28] Oh, better in picture (oh-ooh)
[02:29.09] But never can fill the void
[02:42.59] 
[02:32.84] Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
[02:42.20] Oh, I'm gonna get ready
[02:45.21] For the rain to pour heavy
[02:47.99] Let it fall, fall
[02:51.21] Let it fall upon my head
[03:03.21] 
[02:54.82] All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
[02:58.10] Can't slow down, I'm a rollin' freight train
[03:01.43] One more time, gotta start all over
[03:04.25] Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover
[03:07.30] Woah, how did it come to this?
[03:10.82] Oh, love is a polaroid
[03:14.72] Oh, better in picture (oh-ooh)
[03:18.45] But never can fill the void
[03:31.95] 
[03:21.52] Oh-oh-ooh, love is a polaroid
[03:27.56] Oh-oh-ooh, love is a polaroid
[03:33.70] Oh-oh-ooh, love is a polaroid
[03:39.99] Oh-oh-ooh, love is a polaroid
